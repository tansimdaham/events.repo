      "description": "In the realm of Asgard, the mighty God of Thunder, Thor, is arrogant and self-absorbed. His impulsive behavior leads to a disastrous battle with the frost giants of Jotunheim, resulting in the shattering of the Bifrost, the bridge connecting the Nine Realms. As punishment, Odin, Thor's father, strips him of his powers and exiles him to Earth, along with his hammer, Mjolnir.
In the human world, Thor is thrust into the life of Dr. Jane Foster, an astrophysicist studying the mysterious energy source that emanates from his hammer. With the help of Erik Selvig, a fellow scientist, Thor learns to control his newfound human strength and begins to realize the importance of humility and compassion.
Meanwhile, an old enemy, Loki, Thor's adopted brother, has manipulated Odin into returning to the Odinsleep, a state of prolonged hibernation. Loki seizes the throne of Asgard and unleashes an army of Chitauri warriors to invade Earth.
Thor, now fully reconnected to his inner strength and empathy, returns to Asgard to confront Loki and save his home. With the help of his newfound allies, including Jane Foster, Captain America, Iron Man, and Hulk, Thor defeats Loki and restores peace to both Asgard and Earth."
